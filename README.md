# Differential-equation solver

This project has been carried out in C++. 

The aim of this project is to solve a variety of second order differential equations. 

Stage 1:Solving homogeneous differential equations where the auxiliary equation has real integer roots. These roots maybe repeated. Extend this to handle roots with decimals by using the double data type.

  Status:Complete.

Stage 2: Build on Stage 1 by trying to handle auxiliary equations with complex roots. This involves dealing with the quadratic formula and the fact that we define i = sqrt(-1). After completion of this stage, the program can solve any second order homogeneous equation in a matter of seconds! 

  Status:Complete.
  
Stage 3:
