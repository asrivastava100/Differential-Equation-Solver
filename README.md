# Differential Equation Solver

This project has been carried out in C++. The main project file is init.cpp 

The aim of this project is to solve a variety of second order differential equations. 

Stage 1: Solving homogeneous differential equations where the auxiliary equation has real integer roots. These roots maybe repeated. Extend this to handle roots with decimals by using the double data type.

  Status:Complete.

Stage 2: Build on Stage 1 by trying to handle auxiliary equations with complex roots. This involves dealing with the quadratic formula and the fact that we define i = sqrt(-1). After completion of this stage, the program can solve any second order homogeneous equation in a matter of seconds! 

  Status:Complete.
  
Stage 3: Give the user the option to input a function Q(x). This will introduce the problem of solving non-homogeneous equations. After completion of this stage, only certain types of functions Q(x) will be handled. We will extend this in the next stage.  

  Status:Incomplete.

Other tasks:
Exception handling: This is to ensure that users only enter numeric data   
  
  Status:Incomplete.
